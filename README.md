# Movie-Recommender-System
Using Netflix data provided for their $1 Million Price challenge, developed a movie recommender system via PyTorch based on Stacked Autoencoders

This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) in PyTorch written in Python with the help of NumPy and Pandas. The goal of the project is to predict users' ratings for movies they haven't watched based on their previous ratings, allowing for personalized movie recommendations and the model acheived a Root Mean Squared Error of 0.9517.

*Note: movies.dat, users.dat, ratings.dat, u1.base, u1.test... appear in ml-100k and ml-1m zip files.
